### Introduction to the assembly language
### Goals
- Familiarize yourself writing programs in assembly langauge
- 64 bits ASM, SystemV AMD64 abi calling convention, 16 byte stack alignment
- NASM, intel syntax
- Learning the concept of memory permission and pages
- Non executable stack
### Some extra work
- Introduction to SIMD programming with xmm, ymm registers
  - Boosted performance of regular C strlen by 700+%
  - aligned load, unaligned load, bit map masking
- Exploring loop unrolling and instruction level parallelism
